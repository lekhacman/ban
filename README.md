> Love comforteth like sunshine after rain
>
> But Lust's effect is tempest after sun
>
> Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain
>
> Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done
>
> Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies
>
> Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.
>
> ~ William Shakespeare
